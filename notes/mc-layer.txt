MC Layer (Machine Code Layer)
http://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/intro-to-llvm-mc-project.html

Background
-	LLVM used to use standalone assembler and disassembler programs
	=	Standalone program will revalidate assembly
	=	Requires forking
	=	Old method use to take 20% of compile time
-	Tried direct object emission from CodeGen
	=	Essentially would require re-implementing existing functionality
-	LLVM had some support for assembly and disassembly from JIT tools
	=	Ideal to get an assembler, disassembler, and backend support

Primary MC Classes
-	Two categories "operates on instructions" and "everything else"
-	`MCInst` represents an instruction with operands
	=	Separate from CodeGen's `MachineInstr`
-	`MCSymbol` represents a label
-	`MCSection` represents a uniquely identified section of the current translation unit
-	`MCExpr` base class for assembler expressions need when parsing
-	MC layer lives at a low level as not to depend on the entire CodeGen

MC Components
-	Instruction printer
	=	Target specific component implementing `MCInstPrinter`
	=	Given an `MCInst`, it formats and emits the textual representation
	=	Targets can have multiple instruction printers
	=	Work independently from object file format
-	Instruction encoder
	=	Target specific component implementing `MCCodeEmitter`
	=	Transforms an `MCInst` into a series of bytes and a list of relocations (?)
-	Instruction parser
	=	Allows for parsing of target specific syntax
	=	Target implements `TargetAsmParser`
	=	Lexer is mostly shared code based off common assembly syntax
	=	Once parsed, an instruction is pattern matched into an `MCInst`
	=	If all information is not deducible for an instruction it may be in a relaxed `MCInst` state
-	Instruction decoder
	=	Implements `MCDisassembler`
	=	Turns series of bytes into `MCInst` and size
	=	Target may implement multiple decoders
-	Assembly parser
	=	Handles all the information in a textual assembly file that is not an instruction
	=	Target implements `MCStreamer`
	=	`MCStreamer` has one virtual function per assembly directive and an `EmitInstruction`
	=	`MCStreamer` is implemented by `MCAsmStreamer`
		-=	`MCAsmStreamer` prints directives to textual assembly files
		-=	`MCAsmStreamer` uses `MCInstPrinter` and assembly backend to write object files
-	Assembler backend
	-	An assembler backend is an implementation of `MCStreamer` and `MCAsmStreamer`
	-	Lays out sections and resolves and relaxes instructions
	-	Passes on info to code which writes an object file

`llvm-mc` Tool
-	Tool to access MC layer functionality
