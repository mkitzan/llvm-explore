JIT Compilation
-	JIT (Just In Time), means compile the code at initial use point during runtime
-	Code may be recompiled to factor in runtime performance information into optimizations

Why JIT?
-	Some languages can not be compiled ahead of time (traditionally interpreted languages)
-	Shorten ahead of time compilation time (increase developer productivity)
-	Specialize for code during runtime
	=	Recompile for performance
		-=	Deploying on heterogeneous hardware requires recompilation to account for specialized hardware
	=	Recompile for other reasons

JIT for C++ (ClangJIT)

-	Requirements for a JIT tool
	=	Natural integration into language (C++)
	=	JIT compilation should not access source files during runtime
	=	JIT compilation should not repeat work unnecessarily
-	JIT enabled object file
	=	Serialized AST
		-=	Preprocessed and compressed source files
		-=	Encoded in binary
	=	Compilation command line arguments
	=	Optimized IR
	=	Local symbol table (non-exported symbol in translation unit)
