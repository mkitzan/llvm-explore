Register Allocation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK8TMJf3G6U

Basics
-	Maps virtual registers to target machine registers
-	Limited by target register count and usage conventions
-	Goal to minimize spill / reload code, use as few registers, reduce copy insts
-	Allocation pass pipeline
	=	Live variables
	=	Phi elimination
	=	Two address instructions
	=	Slot indexes
	=	Live intervals
	=	Register coalescing
	=	Machine scheduler
	=	Greedy reg allocator
	=	Virtual reg rewrite
	=	More steps post-allocation
-	`%` prefixes virtual registers and `$` prefixes physical registers

Phi Elimination
-	Phi insts are replaced with copy insts in predecessor blocks and the phi itself
	=	Part of breaking out of SSA
-	Hints to register allocator which values should be assigned to the same register
-	Phi requires an extra copy for itself in case uses of predecessor defs clobber value

Two Address Instructions
-	A two address instruction is one which writes to the same register it reads
	=	SSA requires new def, so it cannot represent this
-	Replace use of original def with a copy of the def
	=	The two address inst will use the copy's def as input and output
	=	Part of breaking out of SSA
-	Commutative operations allow for operands to be swapped
	=	Commutative two address insts may allow for better copy elimination by swapping operands

Register Coalescing
-	Eliminate as many copies
-	If copies do not interfere with uses then copy is eliminated and users replaced with copy source
	=	Interference is where copy source is modified following the copy
	=	Uses prior to source value clobbering could still use source register
		-=	Copy inst could be deferred to point before register value clobbering
		-=	Deferred copy may not make sense if deferral moves copy into a hot control path

Liveness Representation
-	A value which is potentially used later on then it is alive
	=	Fundamentally, if two values are alive at once they should be given unique registers
-	Liveness is represented as intervals
	=	Slot indexes pass numbers instructions which is used to define live intervals
	=	Numbering starts at 0 and increases by 16 for each inst to accommodate potential copies
	=	Live intervals are lists of intervals
-	Slots `B`, `e`, `r`, `d`
	=	`B` slot "Base / Block"
		-=	Indicates beginning of basic block
	=	`e` slot "EarlyClobber"
		-=	Used when inlining assembly
		-=	Output registers of a function must not interfere with input registers
	=	`r` slot "Register"
		-=	Used by typical instruction to read and write values in register
	=	`d` slot "Dead"
		-=	Register is written but never read (liveness will be short - spanning one inst)
-	Value numbering
	=	Each interval is given an SSA-like value number
	=	Includes information about which slot index the value was defined
	=	Value number starting at a `B` slot indicates a control flow join
		-=	Value may be propagated from any predecessor

RegAllocBase
-	Provides infrastructure for creating a register allocator
-	Has a virtual register priority queue
-	LiveRegMatrix for interference checking (tuned B+ tree)
-	Default allocator RegAllocGreedy implemented on RegAllocBase
-	Core loop
	=	enqueue new virtual registers
	=	dequeue virtual register
	=	`selectOrSplit`

RegAllocGreedy
-	`enqueue()` priority queue prioritizes in the following order
	=	Longer global live range
		-=	Generally, more constraints with long live ranges
	=	Live ranges with physical register hints
		-=	ABI and function params allow use of same register they were copied into
	=	Sort block-local ranges in inst order
		-=	Live ranges within a single basic block are sorted and allocated in order
	=	Low priority for virtual registers
-	`selectOrSplit()`
	=	`tryAssign()`
		-=	Cycle through target defined register class register allocation order
		-=	Assign virtual register to first match (if there is a match)
		-=	If no assignment, move onto `tryEvict()`
	=	`tryEvict()`
		-=	Revert an existing assignment if beneficial
		-=	Re-enqueue evicted registers with incremented eviction counter
		-=	Can only evict registers with lower evict counter
	=	`trySplit()`
		-=	Insert a copy in the middle of a live range to split the live range
		-=	May split around loops, constrained target insts, and calls
		-=	`tryLocalSplit()` splits around calls
		-=	`tryInstructionSplit()` splits around constrained insts
		-=	`tryRegionSplit()` / `tryBlockSplit()` split at region boundaries
		-=	Splitting produces new virtual registers which are inserted into the priority queue
	=	`spill()`
		-=	Replace stores after definitions and loads before uses
		-=	`SpillPlacer` determines spill positions
	=	`tryLastChanceRecoloring()`
		-=	If error stage is reached using normal heuristics, attempt a global recoloring to find a match 

Virtual Register Rewriter
-	Allocator stores register mapping in `VirtRegMap`
-	`VirtRegRewrite` pass replaces virtual registers for physical register
-	Builds block live-in list used by later passes
	=	Tracks the registers alive at the beginning of a basic block

`PrologEpilogInsertion` Pass
-	Saves and restores callee saved registers
	=	Callee-saved registers (non-volatile / call-preserved) are used to hold values with a long lifetime
		-=	Opposed to caller-saved registers are temporary values which don't need to be saved across a call
	=	Callee expected values in callee-saved registers to be preserved across a call site 

Register Scavenging
-	Post allocation, during prolog / epilog insertion, temporary value may need to be stored into a register
	=	Stage will insert spills / reloads
	=	Spill space needs to be set in advance of frame setup
		-=	Target must anticipates a spill and leave space on the stack
-	Scavenging stage performs mini regalloc
	=	Can create virtual registers with a single definition
	=	Can only handle users within a basic block
