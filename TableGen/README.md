# Fisher Price TableGen

Diving into LLVM's TableGen domain specific language by writing a TableGen target description for a weird (bad) [8bit assembly language](https://github.com/mkitzan/bare-metal-embedded/tree/master/c/k8-assembly) I developed awhile back. The architecture has two register instructions, single register instructions, instructions with immediate arguments. There's also a single register class.

The `llvm-tblgen` tool can grock the TableGen in this folder, but I doubt whether this would integrate into a large backend for this architecture.

While writing this, TableGen code from the BPF backend and Alex Bradbury's [LLVM backend development by example (RISC-V)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFaIP-dF-RA) talk were particularly helpful references.
